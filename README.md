# Anagram-Recursion

this program takes in a dictionary file and a string of the users choice. The program uses recursion and backtracking (no for loops for practice) to find all possible permutations of a word. Once all permutations are stored in an array, the results are compared with every word in the dictionary file to find the number of matches.
